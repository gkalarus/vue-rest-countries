# 'Find a country' App

An application which integrates [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to pull country data and display it. With this application, the user can perform the following actions:

- see all countries from the API on the homepage,
- search for a country using an input field,
- filter countries by region,
- click on country to see more detailed information on a separate page,
- click through to the border countries on the detailed page,
- use pagination to view content more conveniently.

To build this application, I used Vue.js framework, for state management I used Vuex library, for styling I used components from the Vuetify library and I made an HTTP request with Axios.
